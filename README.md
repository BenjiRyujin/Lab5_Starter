1. You would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because it is too broad of a feature to test. Unit tests would simply test one specific function about the larger feature, rather than testing everything about the functionality or behavior.  
2. You would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of the messaging application because this is a specific function of the feature that can be tested in isolation. Unit tests for this feature can test scenarios where there are less than 80 characters, exactly 80 characters, and more than 80 characters, ensuring that the feature behaves as expected.
